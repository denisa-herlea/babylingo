Babylingo is a system designed to detect and classify different types of baby cries, such as cries due to hunger, tiredness, discomfort, belly pain, or burping. By analyzing audio recordings of a baby's cry, the system uses machine learning models to identify the cause of the cry, helping parents or caregivers understand the baby's needs.
